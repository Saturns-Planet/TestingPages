<p>I am currently a student at Metro Early College Highschool in 9th grade (I'm 14!), although I take classes usually intended for 10th graders. I currently hold a position at The Buckeye Lady on High street.</p>
  <br>
<p> The classes I am currently taking are as follows:</p>
    <p> Biology with Mr. Cox</p>
    <p> Geometry with Ms. Hwang</p>
    <p> English 10 with Mr. Burns</p>
    <p> and Computer Science with Ms. Atala</p>
  
  <h2>My Favorite Types of Things!</h2>
  <p>My favorite book right now is The Song of Achilles by Madelline Miller but my favorite series is the Percy Jackson books by Rick Riordan!</p>
  <br>
  <p>My favorite color is dark green, my favorite color combo is hot pink and lime green, and my favorite shade is charcoal grey.</p>
  <br>
  <p>My favorite musical artist is Neutral Milk Hotel and my favorite song by them is Oh Comely! I also enjoy Maneskin and McCafferty (I dont like McCafferty as a person though, he's actually a really bad nut).</p>
